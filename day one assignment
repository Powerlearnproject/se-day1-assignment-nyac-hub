Part  1: introduction to software engineering
 
 1. software engineering is the application of engineering techniques so as to      design , develop ,test , deploy and maintain computer  programs that are efficient and meet the requirement of its users
 
 2. the three key milestones in evolution of software engineering are:
        the development of the first programing language  {e.g cobol}
        the introduction of the waterfall methodology
        the emergence of agile methodologies
 
 3.  the phases of software development are
        design the software
        develop the software
        testing
        deployment
        mantainance

 4. waterfall  and agile are two popular software development methodologies . Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential process, while the Agile methodology is more flexible and adaptive, emphasizing collaboration and iterative development 
 
 5. scenarios  were waterfall  would be aooropriate
          Building a bridge or a physical infrastructure project.
          Regulatory compliance projects with fixed requirements.
 
 6.agile appropriate
        
â€¢	      Software development (especially web and mobile apps).
o	       Product development where features evolve based on user feedback
 
 
 roles and responsibilities 
 
       software developer   designs  and tests software
       quality assurance engineer ; ensure software meets requirements  and is  of high quality
        project manager; everses  the project ,ensures  timley completion, and manages resources 

importance of IDEs  and  VCS
     IDEs (intergrated development environment) provide a comprehensive development  environment whith tools for coding , and  debugging 
     V CS  (version control system ) help manage to code ,collaborative whith team mentors , and  mantain vrsion history

Examples 
IDECS eclipse visual studio
VCS  , Git ,SVIN


Common challanges  forced by software engineers
   Managing  complexity
   Meeting deadlines
   Ensuring software quality

Strategies  to overcome these  challanges
   Break down  complex systems into smaller components
   Use o agile methodologies to manage  deadlines and requirements
   Implement  continuous testing and feedback

Types of testing
  Unit  testing  tests individual components
  Intergration testing  tests  how componenta interact
 System testing ; tests  the entire system
  Acceptance testing  tests whether the system  meets requirements 

Part 2 : prompt engineering
  Prompt engineering is the manipulation of ai prompts so as to get the most effiscient results  from an ai model

Vague prompt 
   Create an image on  students studying computer  science

Improved prompt
Take an assumption of you being a software engineer professor ,now create an image depicting African  children learning software engineering,also add landmarks and snippets to the image
